        "  -It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
        "   Python is widely used for a variety of applications, from web development to data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.\n",

        "2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "  - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code\n",
        "   line by line, converting it into machine-readable instructions for the computer to execute.\n",
        "  - Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire program into machine code\n",

        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have specific\n",
        "   meanings and purposes in the language.\n",
        "  - These keywords are part of Python's syntax and cannot be used as  \n",
        "   identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names).\n",

        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are\n",
        "   reserved words with specific meanings and roles in the language, so using them as variable names would cause syntax errors.\n",
        "  - WHY NOT :-\n",
        "  - Keywords are an integral part of Python's syntax.\n",

        "  - Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be modified  \n",

        "  -Depending on whether an object can be changed or not, Python objects are classified as either mutable or immutable.\n",

        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. It can be done explicitly (manually by the programmer) or implicitly (automatically by Python when appropriate).\n",
        "   -Type casting is useful when you need to change the type of a variable to perform certain operations or meet specific requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Explicit Type Casting:-\n",
        "       - int()\n",
        "       - float()\n",
        "       - str()\n",
        "       - list()\n",
        "       - tupple()\n",
        "       - bool()\n",
        "\n",
        "   Implicit Type Casting:-\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Python automatically converts data types when required during operations, ensuring compatibility without loss of precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "     Implicit Type Casting:-\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Definition: Python automatically converts one data type to another when it is safe to do so without the need for explicit instruction from the programmer.\n",
        "    - Purpose: Ensures compatibility between data types during operations without loss of information.\n",
        "    - Example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "       x = 5      \n",
        "       y = 2.5    \n",
        "       z = x + y  \n",
        "       print(z)  \n",
        "\n",
        "     Explicit Type Casting:-\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Definition: The programmer manually converts a variable from one data type to another using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "    - Purpose: Provides control over type conversion when automatic conversion is not feasible or desired.\n",
        "    - Example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "     x = \"10\"       \n",
        "     y = int(x)     \n",

        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow a program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions. They enable dynamic behavior, where the flow of execution can change depending on the input or state of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Common Conditional Statements in Python:-\n",
        "\n",
        "     1. if Statement\n",
        "     2. if-else Statement\n",
        "     3. if-elif-else Statement\n",
        "     4. Nested if Statements\n",
        "    \n",
        "  - Example:-\n",
        "     in grading system\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "   - The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to evaluate multiple conditions in a sequence. It works as an extension of an if statement to check additional conditions if the previous conditions were False.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - How It Works:-\n",
        "       1. Python evaluates the if condition first\n",
        "       2. If the if condition is False, it evaluates the elif condition(s) in the order they appear.\n",
        "       3. If an elif condition evaluates to True, its associated block of code is executed, and Python skips the remaining elif and else blocks.\n",
        "       4. If none of the conditions in the if and elif statements are True, the else block (if present) is executed.\n",
        "   - Example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "        x = 15\n",
        "\n",
        "        if x < 10:\n",
        "            print(\"x is less than 10\")\n",
        "        elif x == 10:\n",
        "            print(\"x is equal to 10\")\n",
        "        elif x > 10 and x <= 20:\n",
        "            print(\"x is between 11 and 20\")\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            print(\"x is greater than 20\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - 1. for Loop:-\n",
        "       - Purpose: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string, range, or other iterable) and executes a block of code for each element in the sequence.\n",
        "       - Use Case: When the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a collection\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 2. while loop:-\n",
        "      - Purpose: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.\n",
        "      - Use Case: When the number of iterations is not known beforehand, but a condition dictates the loop's continuation\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.?\n",
        "   - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in situations where the number of iterations cannot be determined in advance and the loop needs to execute until a specific condition is meet.\n",
        "   - Example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "        - Suppose you're building a program that requires a user to enter a valid password. The program should keep prompting the user until they enter the correct password. In this case, you cannot know beforehand how many attempts the user will need, making a while loop the better choice.\n",
